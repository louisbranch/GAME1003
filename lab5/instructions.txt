For this lab, you are going to add the following criteria onto the files we created in the lab. Be sure to download and use the Week 5 Lab Start Package that I posted on Blackboard. Here's what you need to do:

- 1) You're going to be dealing 5 cards to the player and the dealer. It's a simple tally of the point values. Ace can be a value of 1 only, for this lab.
	- You will have to figure out how to deal the cards and then display the cards in their respective spots in the card <divs> in the HTML.
	- You are going to get plenty of extra time to do this lab. Check due date below...
	- You should probably have two extra arrays in JavaScript: one for the player hand and one for the dealer hand.
	- Also have two variables to keep a point total of the two hands.
- 2) Once the hand values are tallied up, you will have to use the "msg" <p> tag at the bottom to display a message such as: "Player total: ##  Dealer total: ##  Player/Dealer wins!"
	- Yes you have to display both totals as well as whoever won.

Again, you are going to get plenty of time to figure this lab out. It is meant to be a challenge for you. I have kept it at the usual 3.75% so give it a try and you can ask me for any help or hints but I can't do it for you.

***NOTE***
----------
Due date is Sunday, Oct 26th at 11:59pm. That's JUST before Week 9 when we come back after the break week!

Zip all three files again and send them with the following naming convention:

Whatever the case, name the file GAME1003_Lab5_LastnameFirstname.zip/.7z/.rar

Send it to arichard6@georgebrown.ca with the same subject (GAME1003_Lab5_LastnameFirstname) as above.
